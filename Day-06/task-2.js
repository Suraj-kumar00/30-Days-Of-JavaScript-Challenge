// Access teh first and last element of the array and log them to the console.

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

//console.log(arr[0],arr[4]); // this is very simple way

let firstElement = arr[0];
let lastElement = arr[arr.length-1]; // which doing "5-1 = 4(index) and it's value is 5 in the array"

console.log("First Element:",firstElement,"Second Element:",lastElement);
